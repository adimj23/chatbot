The curriculum sequence mapped below is a sample sequence, as all Grainger Engineering students work with a department academic advisor to achieve their educational goals, specific to their needs and preparation. Before reviewing the maps below, students should find their effective Academic Catalog Year. When clicking any links referenced in the maps below that take students to the Academic Catalog Year pages, they should be mindful of which Academic Catalog year is displayed.

Before reviewing the links, students should find their effective Academic Catalog Year. When clicking any links referenced below that take students to the Academic Catalog Year pages, they should be mindful of which Academic Catalog year is displayed.

CS 100 is an optional course that is highly recommended for freshmen, who may use it to help meet free elective requirements.
MATH 220 may be substituted. MATH 220 is appropriate for students with no background in calculus. 4 of 5 credit hours count towards degree.
External transfer students take ENG 300.
RHET 105 (or an alternative Composition I sequence) is taken either in the first or second semester of the first year, according to the student's UIN (Spring if UIN is Odd). General Education Elective is taken the other semester. Composition I guidelines can be found at Degree and General Education Requirements under Written Communication Requirement.
Students must take one course from the Natural Science & Technology (NST) list, in addition to those taken as part of the General Education requirements. The course must be one that is allowed for credit by the Grainger College of Engineering.
General education: Students must complete the Campus General Education requirements including the campus general education language requirement. If the option of CS 211 is chosen, it will satisfy a core course requirement and the Campus General Education Advanced Composition requirement.
MATH 415 or MATH 416 may be substituted.
Additional coursework, subject to the Grainger College of Engineering restrictions to Free Electives, so that there are at least 128 credit hours earned toward the degree.
CS 211 may be substituted. The extra 1 credit hour difference between CS 210 and CS 211 will apply to free electives.
CS Technical Electives, selected from department approved list. Technical elective credits totaling 18 hours to include at least three courses from a single focus area and at least one team project course. 
CS Advanced Electives courses must be distinct from courses used to satisfy the technical electives. They may be chosen from CS 397 Individual Study and the 400-level coursework offered for letter grade in ANY area offered at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.


OTHER NOTES:
Course Info:
    - CS 125 is no longer offered at UIUC, it has been split up into CS 124 and CS 128 to give students an easier transition into higher level programming.

    - In CS 124, students have the option to code in Java or Kotlin, while CS 128 uses C++.

    - CS 128 is Intro to Computer Science II, which is a continuation of CS 124. In CS 128, students will learn more advanced programming concepts such as recursion, data structures, and algorithms. The course uses C++ as its primary programming language.

FAQ:
    - The CS advising office for undergraduates can be reached by emailing undergrad@cs.illinois.edu or by calling (217) 333-4428.

    - Students typically take anywhere from 14-17 credit hours, with 18 credit hours being the maximum number of credit hours allowed and 12 being the minimum number of hours allowed. If a student wishes to take more than the maximum allowed number of credit hours (overloading) or less than the minimum (underloading), they must speak with an academic advisor to do so.
